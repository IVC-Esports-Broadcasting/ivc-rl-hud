This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Most components are made off of SVG files, and styles are mostly done in line. Is there a better way to do it? yes. But too rushed to write clean code so sorry for the mess that creates :/

## Bakkesmod and SOS Plugin
Bakkesmod is needed for this project to work, you can find it [here.](https://bakkesmod.com/) SOS plugin is also required, as well as the SOS Websocket Relay which can both be found [here.](https://gitlab.com/bakkesplugins/sos/)
